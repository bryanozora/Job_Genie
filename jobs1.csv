We strive to create lifelong musicians and make a difference in the world by enabling musicians and non-musicians alike to experience the almost indescribable happiness that comes from playing an instrument. We believe in putting our customers first, engaging with respect and integrity and fulfilling our mission with passion.

When Music & Arts opened its doors in 1952, we offered printed music, music lessons, dance lessons, and art supplies. Ben decided shortly after opening his business that he wanted to focus on music to better serve his customers -- a decision that remains intact to this day.

Since the 1990's, Music & Arts has expanded nationwide through organic growth and a series of acquisitions and mergers with other music dealers. In 2005, Music & Arts joined forces with American Music to become the largest band and orchestra instrument retailer in the United States.

"Aircraft Mechanic III  (ALMAT, CA)","Strategic Technology Institute, Inc",Rockville,Not specified,"Third Marine Aircraft Wing (3d MAW) provides logistical support and collateral equipment for 35 flying squadrons and four Marine Aviation Logistics Squadrons (MALS). 3d MAW manages the Flight Hour Program to ensure the goals and mission of the current aviation campaign plan are achieved, and at the forefront of this endeavor is the maximum readiness and effectiveness of all assets and personnel.

2.0 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE
3d MAW’s mission is to provide well trained, organized, and equipped combat ready expeditionary aviation forces capable of short notice worldwide deployments to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), fleet and unified commanders.

3d MAW’s mission success hinges upon the readiness of its assets and personnel. The Aviation Logistics Maintenance Assessment Team (ALMAT) is a critical element in ensuring maximum readiness of assets and personnel through the evaluation, training, and enforcement of all applicable instructions and standards, such as the COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 series, Naval Aviation Maintenance Program (NAMP). During a unit evaluation, nine ALMAT inspectors assess 42 maintenance programs and conduct Material Condition Inspections (MCI) on twenty five percent of assigned aircraft, aviation life support systems, and support equipment assets. In addition, they assess the unit’s procedural adherence and responsiveness to 5 emergency drills and 50 practical application evaluations. ALMAT is unable to perform all assigned duties due to a limited number of inspectors and frequent personnel rotations, which creates a lack of continuity and technical proficiency gap. Evaluations of the 35 squadrons and 4 MALSs will account for approximately 45 weeks in a typical year, but is also contingent upon unit deployment rotations.

In order to further enhance 3d MAW readiness and squadron proficiency, ALMAT requires 6 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) to perform maintenance program evaluations, aircraft and equipment MCIs, emergency response drills, and practical application evaluations.

KAP 2025 -2026 - Social and Digital Marketing Associate - Mercatus Center,Stand Together,Washington,Not specified,"The Koch Associate Program (KAP) is a career accelerator for early to mid-career professionals with a drive to tackle our country’s most pressing challenges in more effective, principled ways. KAP equips associates with the tools, mindsets, and community to succeed as social entrepreneurs—individuals excited to find new and better ways to break barriers and eliminate injustice. Associates spend one day each week engaging in experiential learning with Stand Together Fellowships and work at one of our many partner organizations the rest of the week. Our curriculum is designed to supercharge your development and equip you for long-term success as you seek to have an impact on the problems that prevent people from realizing their potential.

The Mercatus Center at George Mason University seeks a Social and Digital Marketing Associate to help the Marginal Revolution University (MRU) team build a new brand: Econ Nerds. Launching by summer 2025, Econ Nerds will be a video and podcasting platform where experts from the Mercatus Center and beyond can share economic insights with a mass audience. We plan to release new content every week. Unlike MRU’s traditional focus on textbook “Econ 101,” Econ Nerds content will range farther afield, exploring whatever topics appeal to our contributors and viewers. (To give a sense of this: early test videos have covered the impact of containerization on world trade, the irrational ""stonk"" market, and the pricing strategy lessons of OnlyFans.)

We expect social media to be the key driver of Econ Nerds’ audience–and our Social and Digital Marketing Associate will be the key player in building the brand’s social presence. Working with a small team (primarily MRU’s marketing director, our content creators, and a designer), the Associate will provide the social media expertise (and the legwork!) necessary to build a large, engaged audience for Econ Nerds–starting from a blank page. Ideally the brand’s social presence will not merely promote the videos and podcasts, but rather provide popular content in its own right.

Remote, but office space at the Mercatus Center in Arlington, VA will be available if desired.
Role Responsibilities
• Create a social media presence from scratch for the new Econ Nerds brand
• Determine the optimal mix of social platforms
• Define a voice and personality for the brand
• Establish schedules and processes for posting
• Post/promote videos and podcasts created by the Econ Nerds team
• Create original posts to drive engagement and build the audience
• Interact with our social audience
• Collaborate with designers to create any required art
• Create social-friendly clips from videos
• Support and upgrade the existing MRU social media presence
• Create posts to promote new MRU content (videos, interactives, teacher training)
• Evaluate options to improve the MRU social strategy
• Report on each brand’s social performance using social platforms’ native analytics or other tools
• Apply a test-and-learn approach to improve performance over time
• Manage Econ Nerds and MRU advertising on social and other platforms
Minimum Qualifications
• College-level (or better) writing skills in American English, with the ability to write engaging, humorous, and pithy social posts
• Expert, active user of multiple social platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram
• 2+ years managing active corporate/brand social media accounts (or a high-profile personal account)
• 2+ years managing digital ads on social or other platforms
• Strong understanding and appreciation of economics, especially the approaches typical on MarginalRevolution.com. (An econ degree is great, but by itself is neither necessary nor sufficient for this role.)
• Demonstrated success in a remote role is strongly preferred
